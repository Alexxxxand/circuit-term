Terminal to work with circuitpython files for circuitpython boards 

tested on:
rpi pico w

bbc micro:bit v2

note:
if you cant create or change files using circuit-term you need rename boott.py in boot.py and replug your board. but its disabling usb drive. if you want acess to board memory using pc you need rename or delete boot file and replug you board
